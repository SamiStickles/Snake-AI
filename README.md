# Snake-AI

Snake game coded in python. Using a genetic algorithm and a neural network made in Keras,
the program learns how to play the game snake given no rules, only rewards and punishments.

This is a work in progress and the snake does not currently make progress with learning.
The bug is that the snake always converges on one direction and then does that forever.
